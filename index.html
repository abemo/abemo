    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I believe that computers can be used to make our lives better. I research causal reasoning systems, exploring how artificial intelligence can understand cause-and-effect relationships. I earned my bachelor's and master's degrees in Computer Science from Loyola Marymount University in a combined 4 years. Since 2023, I have been conducting AI research at the ARL Army Research Lab. In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis and coaching youth lessons. I'm also passionate about strategy games and games of incomplete information, which challenge players to think critically and adapt to uncertainty.</p>

                <a href="https://www.synthergy.xyz/" target="_blank">Link</a>
                <p>Synthergy is an artificial intelligence (AI) powered social deduction game. Unlike other games in the genre, Synthergy allows players to compete without a full roster of human players by utilizing non-player character (NPC) agents powered by the large language model chat-GPT by OpenAI. These agents are able to mimic all human player actions including writing chat messages, accusing other players, utilizing special actions and abilities, and answering questions.</p>
